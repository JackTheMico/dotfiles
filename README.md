# Jack Wenyoung's dotfiles

After I tried with Manjaro and NixOS, I found the best Linux distribution is
Windows11(and the Linux subsystems on it).
So here are the open-source treasures I use on it, managed by [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io)

## [Komorebi](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi)

The best tiling window manager I can find for Windows.

## [yasb](https://github.com/amnweb/yasb)

Yet another status bar for Windows written in Python.

## [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/)

A new type of shell.

## [starship](https://starship.rs/)

The minimal, blazing-fast, and infinitely customizable prompt for any shell!

## [LazyVim](http://www.lazyvim.org/)

LazyVim is a Neovim setup powered by ðŸ’¤ [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
to make it easy to customize and extend your config.

## [Yazi](https://yazi-rs.github.io/)

Blazing fast terminal file manager written in Rust, based on async I/O.

Vivaldi is packed with powerful built-in features, built for you, who demand more.
